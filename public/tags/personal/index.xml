      <description>It was bad news to read that Omar Roth, the main developer of Invidious, is stepping away from the open source world. But in these cases, when awesome and useful projects are threatened by the discontinuation of their main developer, is when we have to squeeze our heads and think what we can do to solve it. And it is also important to support the person (Omar in this case) with their decision and be grateful for the time they have dedicated to the community.</description>

      <description>So this is my first blog post. And when I say the first I mean the first.
I&amp;rsquo;m not going to blather much on this post, instead I will write the two rules of this blog:
 I will talk about anything I like. I will write when I feel like it.  That&amp;rsquo;s it. This is what you will find here. See you!</description>
