      <description>This week has been great for Parasitter! I have been working on a easy solution in order to protect user&amp;rsquo;s privacy while using Parasitter.
I started relying on Invidious as a &amp;lsquo;third-party&amp;rsquo; to stream the videos and get all the data, but since the announcement that we commented on the previous post I had to change it. So I started a new Parasitter branch where I am working to break any dependency with Invidious.</description>

      <description>It was bad news to read that Omar Roth, the main developer of Invidious, is stepping away from the open source world. But in these cases, when awesome and useful projects are threatened by the discontinuation of their main developer, is when we have to squeeze our heads and think what we can do to solve it. And it is also important to support the person (Omar in this case) with their decision and be grateful for the time they have dedicated to the community.</description>
