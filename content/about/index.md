# About me
Online, I go by the pseudonym Pluja. I am a dedicated Linux user and I have a strange love for cibersecurity. At the moment, Iâ€™m a university student studying to obtain my Degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Systems.

Currently I am working on several personal projects like [kycnot](https://kycnot.me), [Parasitter](https://github.com/pluja/Parasitter) or [CloackMe](https://github.com/pluja/CloackMe). I also run a [website](https://tuprivacidad.org) where I try to concern users about the importance of privacy (it's in spanish!). I've been to many hackathons in the last few years and I've learned and enjoyed a lot, so if you're into hackathons we may have probably met :)

## What I love
I love encryption. I think it is awesome. But also it's somehow hard for me to understand, but I try. I also love Bitcoin and Monero projects and I'm really into them. I love music and anything related to it and I also really enjoy art galleries. I admire the people that fight for freedom and privacy and I fight with them too. I love decentralisation and I think that mesh networks are brilliant. I love doing apnea and climbing mountains. I love nature. I enjoy tabletop games but I'm not into d&g games.
