In this blog series I want to talk about a topic that I really love: cryptocurrencies and blockchain.

I will be learning along the path of writing this. As for now I know the basics and a bit more, but I want to get to an intermediate level. It is said that if you can explain something, and get others to understand it, you can consider that you have knowledge about that. So that's the aim of this series:

I want to prepare myself, read, study and learn in order to write some blog posts where anyone can read it and, with a very basic knowledge, learn about what I'm talking.

**Lerni Kripta** means 'Learn Crypto' in Esperanto. Esperanto is a universal language which I think sounds awesome. Also, the name of my favourite crypto project, comes from Esperanto.
